* Introduction
** Why MOS 6502?
   Writing emulators always a great way to learn how machines work. It's not
   trivial and you have to research a lot in order to do it.

   Emulating *MOS 6502* is a good way to start because it's the processor of
   many well-known devices such as Atari, Apple II, NES, Commodore 64, Tamagotchi... so, if
   you're about to implement a NES emulator, let's start with 6502.
