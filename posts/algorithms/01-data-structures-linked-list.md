# Linked List

- is a linear **collection of data elements**
- each element called a **node**
- nodes a **linked** to each other
- each node is composed by a **data** and a **reference (link)** to a next node in sequence

- linked list allows **efficient insertion and removal** of elements from any position in sequence **during iteration**
- linked list can be used to implement other common data types such as **list**, **stack**, **queue**, **associative array**,...
- linked list vs. array: list elements can easily be inserted or removed **without reallocation or reorganization** of the entrie data structure, because data items **need not to be stored contiguosly in memory**

- therefore, **no random access** on linked list (index). need to scan the list all the time.
- linked list can be allocating or deallocating in **runtime**, array is allocated in **compiling time**
- no need to define an **initial size** for linked list
- used **more memory** than array because of pointers
- difficult in **reverse travelling** linked list
