I happen to use OneNote a lot recently, mainly for storing my handwritten notes thanks to the pretty accurate OCR feature.

Then I realize, there's also a great usage of OCR in OneNote other than just saving notes, it's: **building an electronic index for all of your physical book**.

How?

- Step 1: Install any document scanning app on your phone
- Step 2: Scan all the index pages and table of contents in all of your books
- Step 3: Send it to whatever software you're using that has OCR feature
- Step 4: Now you can search your books digitally

For me, I use Office Lens on my phone and OneNote for OCR. But it's okay to use Scannable/Evernote, and their OCR is well enough to recognize printed texts.

OK, but why?

Every time I tried to look up something, I have to search the index page and table of contents manually. Page by page, for every book on your bookshelf, such a PITA. Are you not believe me? Let's say you have five algorithms books, and you want to find out which book as a definition about =k-d tree=. Can you feel the pain?

Here's how I look it up:

Just half a second and I know I should open =The Algorithm Design Manual= book, and go to page 581 to read about =k-d tree=.

And the search result is limited to just my books, not the whole internet, that's the point of scanning instead of Googling.

I feel more confident to buy more books and throw them at my bookshelf now :P
