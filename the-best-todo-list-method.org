Let me tell you about the +best+ To-Do List System I'm using, the only one you need that could replace every single app on your mobile or your desktop. You are not gonna need =bullet journals=, =google keep=, =org-mode= or =evernote= for to-do list anymore.

A timeless method for to-do list:

What the fuck? You may asked.

I found it's better to use a real to-do list, which you can just put it right under your nose, rather than an electronic one that hidden somewhere in your browser, or buried somewhere as an =org-mode= file, and required some efforts to open it up.

The paper list doesn't go anywhere, you can quickly glance at it, take the pen and write it down immediately when something is coming up, you can't forget it, and it will make you feel more responsibility with the tasks you wrote down.

This is what you need:
- *A piece of paper*
- *A pen* (pencil is okey, I prefer a 6B, but [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pencil#Grading_and_classification][choose your, wisely]])

For an *on-going task*, draw a circle following by a description:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class full-width round :width 750px
[[file:./img/on-going-task.jpg]]

The description should be clear, with the definition of done, do not put something generic or unclear without the goal, you won't make it without a goal.

If you need a deadline, put it on the right side:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class full-width round :width 750px
[[file:./img/on-going-with-deadline.jpg]]

You can even update the deadline:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class full-width round :width 750px
[[file:./img/deadline-changed.jpg]]

When you done with it, just fill the circle, and scratch the whole line out:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class full-width round :width 750px
[[file:./img/finished-task.jpg]]

That's it. The to-do list need to be in short term only, for me, it's just in a day. Any longer schedule should be on a calendar. At the end of the day, I just tear off the page, and throw it away. Carry over the to-do list will ruin your productivity, so don't do that.

Some might say: Why don't you just use =bullet journal=? It's a good method, but it's unnecessary complex, not the right one for me. I don't need a month-long schedule on some piece of paper. I don't need too many statuses for my tasks as well. For notes, I use =org-mode=, it's the thing that we should store electronically.

If you still want to use =bullet journal=, take my advice: Stay away from these fancy to-do lists on Pinterest. I doubt any of those guys who posted fancy to-do lists ever use a to-do list.
